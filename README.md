# top-reviewers-research
Scripts used to scrape web pages for research data.
This set of three scripts was used to collect data on the top reviewers at Amazon. 
The data was scraped from their Amazon profile pages and compiled into a spread sheet for 
analysis by researchers at the University of Alberta.

The script was hastely assembled under tight time constraints over a weekend, and is not
the best coding style, still it works well and contains some interesting and useful code snippets.
